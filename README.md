# file-checker

File Checker is a Java application that checks the chosen directory for files that contain the specified character.

This application was made because certain cloud storage services change file names after download, replacing certain characters with, for example, an underscore.
This can be an annoyance, especially when downloading a large number of files.
Also, Windows Explorer cannot be used to filter special characters, sadly.

This program helps you identify files containing the specified character, so you can easily find and change them.
